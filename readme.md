# A New Webpage
This project is an in-progress prototype for an online forum and basic chatroom styled with late-90s themed css.

## Installation
First of all, please run        `npm install` from the project root.

To compile the Typescript, use  `npm run build`

To run the server, use          `npm run server`

To both build and run, use      `npm run all`.

To view the webpage locally, visit `localhost:3000` from your browser of choice!
Please note: the port may vary depending on which port is set in client.ts and server.ts.

Thank you very much for reading :)
